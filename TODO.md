**#EMANUEL: CAN WE PUT SOMETHING ABOUT UPCOMMING FEATURES HERE? 
+Pulling terrain elevations along 1-D and 2-D profiles
+2-D profiles (one timestep, values at multiple points and draw a line to 
connect the dots). I think this can already be done w/ what we have, but I 
need to verify
+CAN WE ALSO GET MAXIMUM VALUES? WE SHOULD TALK ABOUT THIS. 
+Velocity output
+read in vertices of profile line from csv
+Select plans by name rather than number
+flow across a line? This might be hard
+Current development features include allowing a user to set up a 
configuration file with these as entry, and thus allowing for an arbitrary 
length of coordinate pairs, without over populating an R script. Not sure what
this  means, but copied from below.**
