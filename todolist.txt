- Currently working on querying out long profiles from an hdf files
  - we can find the time step for the model run  under the plan information metadata
  - we can create a sequence based on this with seq(start, end, by = "timeInterval min")

 - There is a bug that on the one-dimension query. Where a user is not able to query multiple stations
   The error message reads:
     Error: Columns `datetime`, `plan_id`, `river_name`, `reach_name`, `values` must be length 1 or 10582, not 10101, 10101, 10101, 10101, 10101 
 - we know that 481 * length(s) = 10582 
 - When we print a debug statement with all of the lengths we get:
   length on creation -----------------------
   the length of datetime -  481 
   the length of river_name -  21 
   the length of values -  10101 
   the length of cross_section -  22 
   lengths in the tibble ----------------------
   the length of datetime -  10101 
   the length of river_name -  10101 
   the length of values -  10101 
   the length of cross_section -  22
