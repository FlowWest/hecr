An R package for interacting with hdf5 files resulting from HEC-RAS 
model runs. `hecr` uses the `h5` package and wraps around it functions that enable 
a user to quickly query out desired data in a tidy dataframe format.

## Installation 

The install requires `devtools`, install with `install.packages("devtools")`.
To install `hecr`:

```r 
devtools::install_github("flowwest/hecr")
```

Installing hecr will install as dependencies: h5, dplyr, purrr, and config. If detected
on the system these will not install, but an update might be required. The latest
versions of both purrr and dplyr are required for hecr to function properly.

## Usage 

The main goal of hecr is to streamline and automate the process of obtaining 
and analyzing output data from plan hdf files created from HEC-RAS unsteady 
simulation model runs. The hecr package provides an interface for obtaining data 
from 1-D cross sections and 2-D point locations and profiles at multiple time 
series or a single timestep. 

Below we walk through simple examples. More complex examples and real world
applications can be found in the [Tutorial (Coming Soon)](#)

**#EMANUEL: CAN WE PUT SOMETHING ABOUT UPCOMMING FEATURES HERE?

+2-D profiles (one timestep, values at multiple points and draw a line to 
connect the dots). I think this can already be done w/ what we have, but I 
need to verify

+flow across a line? This might be hard
+Current development features include allowing a user to set up a 
configuration file with these as entry, and thus allowing for an arbitrary 
length of coordinate pairs, without over populating an R script. Not sure what
this  means, but copied from below.**


## One-Dimensional Domain Queries

*1-D Timeseries Output for a Single Plan* 

The user must provide the 1-D river cross-section name(s) as defined in the model.
A simple example is shown below:

```r
# load in the library
library(hecr)

# first read in the plan hdf file using the hec_file function
f <- hecr::hec_file("inst/raw-data/ArdenwoodCreek.p50.hdf")

# extract timeseries output at a 1-D cross-section using the extract_ts1
water_surface <- hecr::extract_ts1(f, station_name = 6863.627, ts_type = "Water Surface")

# A list of all cross sections from any hdf file can be generated
cross_sections_in_model <- hecr::get_xs_river_stations(f)

# plot
water_surface %>% ggplot(aes(datetime, values, color = plan_name)) + geom_line()

```

![](images/cross_section_single_file.png)

The output data has been transformed to a tidy format and plotted
using ggplot. This is quite an improvement over using the RAS Mapper interface, 
which can often run into memory problems when generating profile data. Additionally,
once the R code has been defined, changes to the plans and model output can be 
read in, plotted, and other analyses performed at the push of a button.

An even more more powerful aspect of hecr is revealed when analysis requires
querying multiple plans at multiple locations within the model domain. 

*1-D Timeseries Output for Multiple Plans*

In this example, we read in a collection of hdf files. This can be accomplished
using the same `hec_file()` function, but this time supply it a directory 
containing the hdf files we are interested in. 

```r
# path to directory with hdf files we wish to query on
f <- hecr::hec_file("inst/raw-data/")

water_surface <- hecr::extract_ts1(f, station_name = 6863.627, ts_type = "Water Surface")

# plot
water_surface %>% ggplot(aes(datetime, values, color = plan_name)) + geom_line()
```

![](images/cross_section_corpus.png)
 
Once again the data is in a tidy form, and so it works great with ggplot or plotly.

If a subset of hdf files from the directory is desired, plan numbers can be 
supplied as a numeric vector to the parameter `plan_numbers` in the `hec_file` 
function.

```r
# query in this directory but only hdf files associated with plans 50, 60, 70
f <- hecr::hec_file("inst/raw-data", plan_numbers=c(50, 60, 70))

# EMANUEL:  CAN WE GET THE METADATA HERE TOO AND PICK BASED ON PLAN NAME?
```

*Developing a 1-D Long Profile* 
Creating a 1-D profile requires extracting output at all 1-D cross-sections
at a particular moment in time. This can be accomplished by using `all_cross_sections` 
and the `timestamp` argument in the `extract_ts1` function as shown below. 

```r

z <- extract_ts1(f, all_cross_sections, timestamp="2005-12-30 02:00:00")
```

As a result, hecr returns output at the `timestamp` value at each of the cross-sections
in the model:

```
#EMANUEL:  REPLACE THIS WITH A LONG PROFILE TIBBLE
# A tibble: 1 x 6
             datetime                         plan_id river_name reach_name cross_section           values
               <dttm>                           <chr>      <chr>      <chr>         <chr>            <dbl>

```

The output can be plotted to reveal the long profile.

**EMANUEL:  CREATE A FIGURE AND PUT IT HERE PLEASE - one long profile**

Ofcourse, this can be expanded to include multple plans:

**EMANUEL:  CREATE A FIGURE AND PUT IT HERE PLEASE - multiple long profiles**

## Two-Dimensional Domain Querries

The same querries can be done for 2-D portions of the model. Examples
similar to those shown above are provided in this section for the 2-D model domain. 

*2-D Timeseries Output at a Single Point for a Single Plan* 
For 2-D model output, the user must provide a set of coordinates defining 
the point at which results are desired. Coordinates can be extracted from 
RAS Mapper by double-clicking the ruler tool **(EMANUEL: HOW DO I ADD A JPG?)** in 
the 2-D model domain. 

```r
# read in file
f <- hecr::hec_file("inst/raw-data/ArdenwoodCreek.p50.hdf")

# set up coordinate to query for
coord <- c(6103057.45033481, 2027049.43985547)

x <- hecr::extract_ts2(f, xy = coord, ts_type = "Water Surface")

# tidy data
print(x3)
```

`hecr` uses the distance formula to locate the nearest cell centerpoint and 
reports output for that cell. The resulting tibble records the cell index that
was selected.

```
# A tibble: 481 x 5
              datetime          plan_name time_series_type hdf_cell_index           values
                <dttm>              <chr>            <chr>          <dbl>            <dbl>

Plotting 

```r
x %>% ggplot(aes(datetime, values)) + geom_line()
```

![](images/two-dim-one-file.png)


*2-D Timeseries Output at a Single Point for Multiple Plans* 

Much like the one dimensional part, we can set up a collection of hdf files and query all 
of them for a given coordinate: 

```r

# create a collection of plan hdf files
f <- hecr::hec_file("inst/raw-data/", plan_numbers=c(50, 80))

# query output from all files defined in the collection
x <- hecr::extract_ts2(f, coord, ts_type = "Water Surface")

# plot 
x %>% ggplot(aes(datetime, values, color = plan_name)) + geom_line()
```

![](images/two-dim-multiple.png)

*2-D Timeseries Output at Multiple Coordinates Across Multiple Plans*

Multiple timeseries output can be querried at mutliple locations for multiple plans.
`extract_ts2` will accept sets of ordered pairs as a vector or a matrix. 

```r
# create a matrix of coordinates of interest
m <- matrix(c(6099816.76262168,	2030896.94257798,
              6099866.76262168,	2030896.94257798,

              6100266.76262168,	2030896.94257798,
              6100316.76262168,	2030896.94257798,
              6100366.76262168,	2030896.94257798,

              6106366.76262168,	2030896.94257798), ncol = 2, byrow = TRUE)

# query the hdf files
x <- hecr::extract_ts2(f, xy=m, ts_type="Water Surface")

# plot 
x %>% 
  ggplot(aes(datetime, values, color=as.character(hdf_cell_index))) + 
  geom_line() + 
  facet_grid(~plan_name)
```

*Generating 2-D Profiles* 
BETHANY LEFT OFF HERE. I'LL WORK ON THIS SECTION NEXT

Sometimes a user may want to capture a snapshot in time rather than producing 
timeseries data. Output at a particular time can be specified as an argument 
to `extract_ts1`. 

```r
z <- extract_ts1(f, "44930.9*", timestamp="2005-12-30 02:00:00")
```

As a result, hecr returns only output at the `timestamp` value in each hdf file 
specified:

```
# A tibble: 1 x 6
             datetime                         plan_id river_name reach_name cross_section           values
               <dttm>                           <chr>      <chr>      <chr>         <chr>            <dbl>
1 2005-12-30 10:00:00 Q100_ExistBaseline_Wet_20170307 AlamedaCk2   Upstream      44930.9* 27.0153141021729
```


## MetaData 

A lot of current development is associated with capturing all the required metadata 
from hdf files. Here show current features. 

We can query metadata from any object read in with `hec_file()` 

```r
meta <- hecr::hec_metadata(f)
```

```
# A tibble: 1 x 4
                          plan_id                       plan_name
                            <chr>                           <chr>
1 Q100_ExistBaseline_Wet_20170307 Q100_ExistBaseline_Wet_20170307
# ... with 2 more variables: plan_file <chr>, time_window <chr>
```

Every dataframe obtained with one of the `extract_*` functions has attached to it 
a reference to the collection that created it. This allows for easy creation of 
helper pipe functions like `append_meta()` when we want to attach extra columns to 
a given dataframe 

```r
# x is an already existing dataframe from calling extract_ts2
# add metadata columns to the dataframe
y <- x %>% append_meta() 
```

Future releases will make extensive use of this type of functionality.
