# Introduction

The goal of the hecr package is to give a user a simple and consistent interface
to retrieving data from an hdf file produced by running a HEC-RAS model. Data 
resulting from hecr function calls are all in a tidy form, thus allowing a user
to use any tidyverse tool. The consistancy in hecr interface and the data returned
from it, allows for the possibility of automation, a topic to be covered in an 
advanced tutorial. 

In the remaining of this document, we cover in detail the usage and real world 
application of the hecr package.
