*Current Status*

So far the package can get extract either one or two dimensional portions of a model
run from an hdf file. Recent work made it so that one could create a corpus of hdf 
files and query all of them at once. This has been implemented for the 1d portion 
of things, 2d is yet to be implemented. This will be tasks in the coming updates. 



### 2017-09-06 
 
Current feature set is, reading a single hdf file from disk and extracting either
and 2d portion of the model using a single x, y coordinate, or extracting a 
cross section portion of the model using a cross section location. 
 
Today will work on 2d features namely:
* add multiple coordiante query for one hdf file 
* add multiple hdf file queries per one coordinate
